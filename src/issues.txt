Needs fixing:

- Does not account for kickoffs, because plays where neither team
has possession are removed from the dataset and WP is extrapolated from
the play before it.

- Is only from a "home team" win probability 
perspective and therefore can only really be 
read as a prediction for the home team
    - though im not sure about this, we might
    just be able to extrapolate it

- Overtime clumping may still be present

- Accuracy of plots is questionable
    - i.e., comparing "2025_16_LA_SEA" to actual
    plots is really odd

- Some huge one-play swings which I don't understand

- Why doesn't it end at 100% sometimes ? could just be close games

- Algorithm is assuming that overtime lasts 10 minutes - I think this is different in
playoff games? (check for maximum game time remaining in OT, shouldnt be hard)

- I don't love that you had to spam .data$ to avoid squigglies
