To add in the future:
- Identifying and marking plays with large WP/EPA swings
    - Adding and marking scoring plays

- Adding aesthetics (colors, frames, more pleasing angles)

- Add final score

- Make it interactive!
    - Hover over scoring/impactful plays to see
    play description
    - Hover over line to see WP%
    - Input a game state to see your probability

- Come up with a way to compare zachs_wp to nflfastR wp
    - which is better over a single game? 
        - possibly avg. distance from outcome over the game,
        maybe multiplied by time to game end
    - maybe even quantify what accounts for large differences
    in wp

- find teams with the lowest winning % over a whole season
    - least time over 50% win prob (by game_seconds_remaining)
